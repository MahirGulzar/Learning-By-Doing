__LEARN BY DOING__ is a [concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning-by-doing) that promotes hands on practice in the learning process. 
This repo contains material relevant to my own **learn-by-doing** process, especially (currently) during my studies at [UT](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en).
Its aim is for self-reference, and fellow schoolmates reference.
